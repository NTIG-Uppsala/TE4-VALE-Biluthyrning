### Compiling

In order to compile the project, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) has to be installed and working.
Afterwards install the required packages with:

``npm install js-yaml handlebars``

To compile the project, run the [hbs-compile.js](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/scripts/hbs-compilor.js) script with:

``node scripts/hbs-compilor.js``

This will generate all the necessary html files from the [index.hbs](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/hbs/index.hbs) file.

### Changing Open Opening Hours

To change the opening hours that appear on the site, you have to change the object in the [openHours.js](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/public/js/openHours.js) file.

To change closed days change the text content of a table in the [index.hbs](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/hbs/index.hbs) file and change the closedDates object in the [openHours.js](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/public/js/openHours.js) file.

### Changing other essential information.

There are two spots in the [index.hbs](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/hbs/index.hbs) file that specify the phone number. Change both spots.

To change which cars are available or their price (which should include VAT) edit the corresponding table in the [index.hbs](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/hbs/index.hbs) file. To change the VAT tax simply change the value of the "vat" constant in [vatOnCars.js](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/public/js/vatOnCars.js).

To change which ZIP codes that are delivered to and their price change the [listOfZIPCodes.js](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/public/js/listOfZIPCodes.js) file as well as the noscript span of the [index.hbs](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/hbs/index.hbs) file.

To change the E-mail change the innerHTML and the value of the href-attribute of one element in the footer of the [index.hbs](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/hbs/index.hbs) file.

To change the address change the innerHTML and the value of the href-attribute of one element in the footer of the [index.hbs](https://github.com/NTIG-Uppsala/TE4-VALE-Biluthyrning/blob/main/hbs/index.hbs) file.

When making changes to any of the above files also make sure to add that change to its correlating python testing file.

### Manual and Automated Testing

The project currently uses GitHub workflows to automate the testing of any files pushed to the following branches: main, gh-pages, validation-testing, live, and validation-and-automation-testing. To change which branches are tested open .github/workflows/automated-tests.yml and .github/workflows/w3c-validation.yml and under "branches:" remove or add desired branches.

To manually conduct the w3c validation tests open [this page](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload) and submit the desired html-files.

To manually conduct the automated content testing install Python version 3.12.5 and run the following commands in the terminal: 

``pip install pytest-playwright playwright pytest-json-report``

``python -m playwright install``

To add more Python tests either add more methods (which start with test*) in the existing test*.py files or create a new file with the test*.py format using the template in "tests/template.py" but with a changed class-name.
