# Backend Setup

1. To properly setup and configure everything the following commands needs to be run:

```bash
npm install
```

2. The repository does not track a required `.env`-file due to security reasons. The file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmhCGe8ItjaIrP0iR04PWg-1RiKhOH2k/view?usp=drive_link). Download it and place it in the root-directory of the project. The file might be downloaded as `env` and needs to be renamed to `.env`.
